educational material for STEM2SHTEM 2022

created to educate my lab of high school researcher interns in the Stanford SHTEM program over the summer of 2022. We studied statistical methods, programming and machine learning (specifically data selection) and submitted our work to the Journal of Emerging Investigators.
